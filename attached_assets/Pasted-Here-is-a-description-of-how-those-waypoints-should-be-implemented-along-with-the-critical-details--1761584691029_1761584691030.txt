Here is a description of how those waypoints should be implemented, along with the critical details your Replit program needs.1. Core Constraint: Orthogonal RoutingThe primary rule is that the connector line must only use horizontal and vertical segments. It must never use diagonal lines. This is called orthogonal line routing.Allowed Shapes:The path between two entities (Node A and Node B) should be constrained to a maximum of three segments and two waypoints (or one, or zero):Waypoint CountShapeDescription0Straight LineA single vertical or horizontal segment (occurs if A and B are perfectly aligned).1L-Shape (90° Angle)Two segments and one waypoint, forming a sharp corner.2Z-Shape (or U/C-Shape)Three segments and two waypoints, forming two right-angle corners. This is the common "Z" or "stair-step" path.Key Rule: Waypoints must only be placed at the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical segment.2. Waypoint Placement and MovementWaypoints in this orthogonal system are not arbitrary; their positions are calculated based on the start/end points and the routing path.Snap to GridThe entire routing must adhere to a visible or invisible grid.Grid: Define a fixed grid size (e.g., $10$px or $20$px).Waypoint Coordinates: All waypoint coordinates ($x, y$) must be multiples of the grid size. This ensures clean alignment when segments run side-by-side or parallel to others.Implementation Detail: When a user attempts to drag a waypoint, you must round the resulting coordinates to the nearest grid line.$$\text{Waypoint } x = \text{round}(x / \text{GridSize}) \times \text{GridSize}$$Movement ConstraintA user doesn't drag a waypoint freely; they drag a waypoint to define a new clearing distance.If the path is H-V (Horizontal then Vertical), dragging the waypoint horizontally only moves the vertical segment's position. Dragging it vertically only moves the horizontal segment's position.The key is that dragging one waypoint only affects the position of its two connected segments, while keeping them perpendicular.3. Implementation Details for ReplitTo implement this correctly, your Replit program needs to define and manage the following:A. Line DefinitionEach connector line shouldn't just store Start ($x_s, y_s$) and End ($x_e, y_e$). It needs an array of coordinates for the segment points:$$\text{Line} = [P_s, WP_1, WP_2, \dots, P_e]$$$P_s$: Start point on Node A's edge.$WP_i$: Waypoint coordinate.$P_e$: End point on Node B's edge.B. Routing Preference (The Waypoint Logic)Your program needs a logic layer that determines the path type and calculates the waypoint coordinates. This logic typically defaults to the simplest path:Routing TypeWaypoint WP1​Waypoint WP2​When to UseH-V (L-Shape)$(x_e, y_s)$N/ADefault, simplest path.V-H (L-Shape)$(x_s, y_e)$N/ASimple path, often chosen if one node is directly above/below the other's x range.H-V-H (Z-Shape)$(x_{mid}, y_s)$$(x_{mid}, y_e)$When an intermediate clearance is needed (i.e., dragging to move the vertical segment).V-H-V (Z-Shape)$(x_s, y_{mid})$$(x_e, y_{mid})$When an intermediate clearance is needed (i.e., dragging to move the horizontal segment).User Action Mapping:When a user drags a waypoint, the program must:Identify if the drag is intended to be horizontal or vertical (e.g., based on the initial drag direction).Calculate the new cleared distance ($x_{mid}$ or $y_{mid}$) based on the snap-to-grid rule.Recalculate both waypoints for the chosen Z-shape route using the new distance. The line then re-draws with the two new, correctly-aligned waypoints. The user is essentially only defining one distance ($x_{mid}$ or $y_{mid}$), and the two waypoints snap into place based on that distance.This system is what gives the lines their clean, organized, and constrained "Z-like" appearance, preventing them from being dragged to arbitrary, non-orthogonal positions.
